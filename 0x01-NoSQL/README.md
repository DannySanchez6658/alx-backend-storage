# NOSQL

## Overview

This is a project done in the aim of learning about **NoSQL** while attending **ALX Full Stack Software Engineering** program.

## What I've Learned

### 1. What is NoSQL?

NoSQL, which stands for "Not Only SQL," is a type of database management system that's different from traditional relational databases (SQL databases). It's designed to handle various types of data, especially unstructured or semi-structured data.

### 2. Types of NoSQL Databases

There are different types of NoSQL databases, including:
- Document Stores (e.g., MongoDB)
- Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis)
- Column-family Stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra)
- Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j)

Each type has its unique characteristics and use cases.

### 3. NoSQL vs. SQL

NoSQL databases are more flexible and suitable for scenarios where data is diverse and not well-structured. In contrast, SQL databases have a fixed schema and are ideal for structured data with complex relationships.

### 4. Use Cases

I've explored various real-world use cases for NoSQL databases, such as managing user profiles in gaming apps, handling social media posts, and storing IoT sensor data.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository serves as a personal reference for my NoSQL learning journey. Here's how you can use it:

- Browse the folders and files to access my notes and summaries.
- Use the code examples to experiment with NoSQL databases and apply the knowledge gained.
- Feel free to add more information and notes as you learn and understand more about NoSQL.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to acknowledge the online tutorials, documentation, and resources that have helped me in my NoSQL learning journey.

**Happy Coding!**
